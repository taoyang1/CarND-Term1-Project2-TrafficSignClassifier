    "### Writeup / README\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Provide a Writeup / README that includes all the rubric points and how you addressed each one. You can submit your writeup as markdown or pdf. You can use this template as a guide for writing the report. The submission includes the project code.\n",

    "### Data Set Summary & Exploration\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Provide a basic summary of the data set. In the code, the analysis should be done using python, numpy and/or pandas methods rather than hardcoding results manually.\n",
    "\n",
    "I used the pandas library to calculate summary statistics of the traffic signs data set:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The size of training set is: 34799\n",

    "* The size of test set is: 12630\n",
    "* The shape of a traffic sign image is: 32*32\n",
    "* The number of unique classes/labels in the data set is: 43\n",

    "#### 2. Include an exploratory visualization of the dataset.\n",

    "\n",
    "![bar chart of the distribution of the original training dataset ][image1]\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the dataset is not balanced, i.e., some class (i.e., class 2) has more than 10 times data than other classes (i.e., class 0). Therefore, we need data augmentation for better result.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Design and Test a Model Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Describe how you preprocessed the image data. What techniques were chosen and why did you choose these techniques? Consider including images showing the output of each preprocessing technique. Pre-processing refers to techniques such as converting to grayscale, normalization, etc. (OPTIONAL: As described in the \"Stand Out Suggestions\" part of the rubric, if you generated additional data for training, describe why you decided to generate additional data, how you generated the data, and provide example images of the additional data. Then describe the characteristics of the augmented training set like number of images in the set, number of images for each class, etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "As a first step, I decided to convert the images to grayscale because it reduces the input size by three fold.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a last step, I normalized the image data because LeNet works better for normalized data, i.e., zero mean with small variance.\n",
    "\n",
    "I decided to generate additional data because the imbalance distribution of training dataset among different classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "To add more data to the the data set, I used the following techniques because it gives more data for those rare cases:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. For class with less than 500 counts, generate three rotated images with rotation angles between -10 and 10 degrees.\n",
    "2. For class with more than 500 but less than 1000 counts, generate on rotated copy with rotation angles between -10 and 10 degrees.\n",
    "3. For all data, generate one additional translated copy with translation in -4 and 4 pixels (exclude 0). Dataset is divided into three batches for faster processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The difference between the original data set and the augmented data set is the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. New data set has 114056 training data vs 34799 in the old dataset. This is roughly 3.5 times more.\n",
    "2. The distribution of augmented dataset.\n",
    "![Training data distribution among different classes][image3_1]\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Describe what your final model architecture looks like including model type, layers, layer sizes, connectivity, etc.) Consider including a diagram and/or table describing the final model.\n",

Include in the discussion the results on the training, validation and test sets and where in the code these were calculated. Your approach may have been an iterative process, in which case, outline the steps you took to get to the final solution and why you chose those steps. Perhaps your solution involved an already well known implementation or architecture. In this case, discuss why you think the architecture is suitable for the current problem.\n",

    "* validation set accuracy of 0.934\n",
    "* test set accuracy of 0.921\n",
    "\n",
    "Some notes:\n",
    "* I use the LeNet as the starting point because of its relative complexity.\n",
    "* The learning rate and number of epochs are found to be important parameters to tune. They are tuned by the guidance of loss curve. If the loss is slow to going down, then we should be increase the learning rate. If otherwise it's oscillating, then a smaller learning rate should be tried.\n",
    "* Dropout is used to avoid overfitting and make the model more robust.\n",
    "* The model reaches 0.95 validation accuracty and 0.924 test accuracy, which is pretty good.\n",
